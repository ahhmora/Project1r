Alexandra MORA
somehow still here 
SP'24

Intro
Born in Los Angeles, Alex grew up in an intense and culturally rich family of newly emigrated Mexicans, absolutely drenched in pride. Spanish is her first language, and language and culture was everything to her family. They took this approach passionately, and quickly grew a highly successful Spanish language advertising agency, which targeted the Hispanic Market in Los Angeles. Alex grew up paying close attention to which brands got you to look, think, who was just selling, and who was inspiring so much more.

As a young girl living in a house with seven women, it was all about beauty, fashion, and food. Naturally, Alex grew to become a master consumer, and lover of all these things. Her 8th grade prediction was that she’d be the CEO of the Gap. Years later she found herself at the operational frontlines of American Apparel. She learned the intricacies of manufacturing, fine tuned her aesthetic, learned what quality materials really mean, and learned how to drive consumer and community loyalty through words and events. As she began to grow both personally and professionally, she became radically aware of where these things converge and how she could engage all aspects of herself, both inherent and developed.

A natural right brain, Alex has taken all of her real world experiences with exploding brands to have the operational foresight to lean in with left brain objectivity. Alex proudly created campaigns like “Legalize Gay” for American Apparel in the mid 2000’s and helped grow the brand in over 30 countries. She applied that knowledge to build and engage a global social media community for TOMS. She's served as COO for a plant based food startup. These experiences have shaped a tremendous understanding of how to build a solid, scalable, and inspiring brand mission, identity, and operation.

But most importantly it’s fueled her desire to use it to build global community united with purpose.
